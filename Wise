A simple five‑year, three‑statement financial model for valuing Wise plc (listed on the London Stock Exchange).  
The model is built using Wise’s FY2024 Annual Report as the base year and includes fully linked Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement projections.

Using the forecasted Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE), the model applies a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to estimate equity value.
It also derives potential shareholder returns over a five‑year horizon, including Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC).

This project is intended as a straightforward demonstration of three‑statement modelling, valuation logic, and equity return analysis.
